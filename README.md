# Aura High TTRPG
HTML TTRPG Character sheet implementation for Aura High campaign

## Campaign setting

It has been sixty-one years since the world changed forever. 
When the sky split open above Japan and nuclear fire met the unknown… the Otherworld answered.
From that rift came chaos. And from chaos… came magic. 
Now, magic is everywhere—woven into our very lives. 
Some wield it with honor, to protect the innocent from the beasts that crossed over… Others chase power, their hearts twisted in the darkness. 

The year is 2006. 
Shin-Yokohama: a city caught between two worlds.
And within it… Aura High.
A school where gifted youths awaken their potential—and where the fate of the world may rest in the hands of its students.

This is their story.

## Combat

### Combat start
When entering combat, turn order is determined by speed / 20 + 1d20, highest value go first, ties are decided by the character with higher speed going first.

### Combat turn
A turn by a character may look something like the following:

Optional movement of up to speed / 5 tiles (movement taken here reduces available movement later in the turn).

The player may then take an action:
- Cast a spell
- Drink a potion
- Perform a physical attack

More optional movement using remaining available tiles.

The player may optionally consume a cunning action (fully restored on long rest) to perform another action.
Some spells, like haste, may grant a bonus turn on the turn they are cast and on following turns. If a bonus action is not used it is not passed on to the next turn.

### Dealing and taking damage
Any spell cast is assumed to hit unless the target takes the dodge reaction (a number of speed / 20 dodge reactions may occur between a characters turns). The character taking the dodge action rolls 1d20 against their dodge challenge stat, they must meet or beat the challenge to perform the dodge. Not all effects can be dodged, this is at the discretion of the DM. Dodge attempts where the roll is below 4 critically fail and the character performing the failed dodge takes an aura loss.

Physical attacks can be performed within 1 tile of the target (unless otherwise specified) and can be dodged. They deal power damage to their target.
Players have built in percentage damage resistance based on their fortitude (starting from fortitude 20) where up to 40% of damage can be mitigated. This calculation is built into the character sheet.

## Common Spells

Common spells are available to all magic users once they have learned the spell. A list of available spells is as below. Spells can be learned at 3 different levels; normal, greater, and supreme. Generally first years will only be capable of learning normal level common spells.

- Haste (Increases speed by 10 / 20 / 40 and grants bonus actions)

- Insight (Increases intelligence and magic reserves by 10 / 20 / 40 and grants temporary mana)

## Potion brewing

Potions can be brewed by students that have gathered the reagents required for the potion. These reagents can generally be foraged for, taken as drops from encounters, or bought. A list of common potions, their ingredients, and their effects is as below.
When brewing a potion the efficacy is determined by adding 1d20 to the character's alchemy modifier and calculating the percentage of maximum efficacy, the reagent will also have a % realisation of maximum efficacy. Be sure to take note of reagent quality when gathering reagents.
